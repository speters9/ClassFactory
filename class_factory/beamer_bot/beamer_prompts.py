   ### Source Documents and Examples

   1. **Lesson Objectives**:
      - We are on lesson {lesson_no}.
      - Ensure each slide works toward the following lesson objectives:
      {objectives}

   2. **Lesson Readings**:
      - Use these readings to guide your slide content:
      {information}

   ---

   ### General Format to Follow:

   1. **Title Slide**:
      - Copy the prior lesson's title slide, **leave author and institution blank**.

   2. **Where We Are in the Course**
      - Last time: <Title of last lesson>
         - The readings from last lesson (Lesson {prior_lesson}).
         - **Include every assigned reading from this lesson.**
      - Today: <Title of the current lesson>
         - The readings for the current lesson (Lesson {lesson_no}).
         - **Include every assigned reading from this lesson**

   3. **Lesson Objectives**:
         - The action in each lesson objective should be bolded (e.g. '\\textbf(Understand) the role of government.')

   4. **Discussion Question**:
      - Add a thought-provoking question based on lesson material to initiate conversation.

   5. **Lecture Slides**:
      - Cover key points from the lesson objectives and readings.
      - Ensure logical flow and alignment with the objectives.

   6. **In-Class Exercise**:
      - Add an interactive exercise to engage and re-energize students.
      - This exercise should occur about halfway through the lecture slides, to get students re-engaged.

   7. **Key Takeaways**:
      - Conclude with three primary takeaways from the lesson. These should emphasize the most critical points.
      - Bold or italicize the key terms for emphasis.

   8. **Next Time**:
      - Provide the title of the next lesson.
      - Include the assigned readings for the next lesson.

   9. **References**:
      - This slide should have only one thing on it:
      - %\\printbibliography

   ### Example of previous presentation:
   - Use the presentation from last lesson as an example for formatting and structure:
   {last_presentation}

   ---

   ### IMPORTANT:
   - Use valid LaTeX syntax.
   - The output should contain **only** LaTeX code, with no extra explanations.
   - Start at the point in the preamble where we call \\title.
   - Failure to follow the format and style of the last lesson's presentation may result in the output being rejected.
   - Use the **same author and institute** as provided in the last lessonâ€™s presentation. Do not invent new names or institutions. Copy these values exactly from the prior lesson.
   - If unable to identify the author and institute from the last lesson, just leave them blank.
   - Failure to follow these instructions will result in the output being rejected.
